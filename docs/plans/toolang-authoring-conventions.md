# Toolang Authoring Conventions

## Status

Proposed for human confirmation. These conventions apply across Toolang source
and its consumers. They do not introduce syntax or replace parser requirements.
Flow examples use the separately proposed readable flow statement syntax.
Parser behavior is defined in
[Readable Flow Statements](readable-flow-statements.md).

## Principle

Toolang source should explain itself. Prefer clear verbs, runnable names, and
natural prose over comments. Add a comment only when it supplies a description
needed by a consumer or information that the source cannot express directly.

Keep comments rare, short, and close to what they describe.

## Natural Language

Toolang deliberately keeps authored instructions close to natural language.
Write prompt bodies, agic messages, implicit runs, and other authored content as
ordinary prose.

### Implicit runs

Write implicit runs as natural prose:

- Start English prose with normal sentence capitalization.
- End prose with appropriate punctuation.
- Use blank lines to make transitions between prose and explicit flow
  statements visually clear.

Capitalization and punctuation are authoring conventions, not requirements for
implicit text. They must not exclude interpolation, quoted text, numbers, or
languages without English letter case.

```too
flow research:
  Identify the important uncertainties in the question.

  storm 8 in 4 lanes using investigate
  sort descending by confidence

  Write an answer supported by the strongest findings.
```

## Type Annotations

Omit parameter and return types when Toolang's defaults already express the
runnable contract:

- an omitted parameter list implies a primary `_` input of `Part[]`;
- an explicit untyped `_` also defaults to `Part[]`;
- an untyped named parameter defaults to `Text`; and
- an omitted return type defaults to `Part[]`.

Prefer:

```too
agic transform:
  Transform the current input.

agic rewrite(_, instruction):
  Rewrite {{_}} according to {{instruction}}.
```

over redundant signatures:

```too
agic transform(_: Part[]) -> Part[]:
  Transform the current input.

agic rewrite(_: Part[], instruction: Text) -> Part[]:
  Rewrite {{_}} according to {{instruction}}.
```

Add a type only when it differs from the default or communicates a contract
that the consuming syntax does not already determine. Keep `()` when a
runnable intentionally accepts no primary input, and keep `?` when a named
parameter is optional.

Do not repeat a return type that the consuming context already determines.
Inline runnables after `if` and `by` are the common cases, with `Boolean` and
`Number` results respectively:

```too
keep if:
  Return true when the current item is actionable.

sort descending by:
  Score the current item by priority.
```

## Documentation Comments

Use `##` when the text is documentation that a consumer may display. Place it
immediately above the item or statement it describes, with no blank line in
between. Prefer one concise line.

### Runnable descriptions

A `##` comment immediately above an `agic` or `flow` supplies its runnable
description when the source is used as a script.

```too
## Review a change and return prioritized findings.
agic review -> ReviewResult:
  ...

## Investigate a question and produce a supported answer.
flow research(question) -> Answer:
  ...
```

Describe the capability or result. Do not repeat the declaration name,
parameters, or return type.

### Flow stage descriptions

A `##` comment immediately above a flow statement supplies its plan phase or
stage description for UI and progress displays.

```too
flow research:
  ## Generate independent approaches
  storm 8 in 4 lanes using investigate

  ## Review proposals in parallel
  map in 4 lanes using review_proposal

  ## Prioritize the strongest findings
  sort descending by confidence
```

Start with an action verb and describe the purpose of the stage. Do not merely
translate the statement into prose.

```too
# Avoid: restates the syntax without adding intent.
## Run investigate eight times in four lanes
storm 8 in 4 lanes using investigate
```

Use `##!` only when the parent or the complete script needs a description. A
source file should rarely need more than one parent documentation comment.

## Ordinary Comments

Use `#` for short, human-only rationale or constraints that should not become a
runnable or stage description.

```too
# Keep this limit within the provider quota.
storm 8 in 4 lanes using investigate
```

Avoid comments that narrate the syntax, long design notes, and frequent inline
comments. Prefer a short standalone line when a comment is necessary, and keep
comments outside natural-language content.

## Review Checklist

- Can clearer source or a better name remove the comment?
- Does each `##` provide useful consumer-facing text?
- Is each `##` immediately adjacent to its target?
- Does each `#` explain rationale or a constraint instead of restating code?
- Can every remaining comment be shortened?
